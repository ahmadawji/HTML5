        <p class="title"> History HTML5</p>
        <p class="center">Right around the period that HTML advanced to version 4.01
            (around 1998), the ground began to shift a bit. Developers started
            to talk about this next new thing the W3C was working on: XHTML,
            which stood for “Extensible Hypertext Markup Language.” This first
            1.0 specification was more or less identical to HTML 4.01, other
            than the inclusion of a new MIME type, application/xhtml+xml.
